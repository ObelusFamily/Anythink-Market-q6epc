# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
1. we need to install git.
2. need to setup the git local with git config --global user.name and user.email commands.
3. install Docker. 
4. clone the repository to your local storage.
5. create a new branch and do changes in it.
6. Commit the change and push it with your branch and create a pull request.
7. when the pull request gets approved merge it with the main branch.
